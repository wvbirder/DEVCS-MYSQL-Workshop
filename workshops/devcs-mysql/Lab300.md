## Introduction

The Agile methodology of software development is a type of incremental model that focuses on process adaptability and customer satisfaction. In Oracle Developer Cloud Service, you can use the Agile methodology to manage issues using Scrum and Kanban boards. Although we will not be creating an Agile board and Issues in this lab Developer Cloud Service fully supports team development.

This lab will focus on a developer persona (Serena) having to make a couple of changes to the AlphaOfficeUI. One is a bug fix and the others are cosmetic.

- The commit will fire off a new Build and Redeploy of `AlphaOfficeUI`. You can monitor the progress of both by going to the Build and Deploy links respectively. It will take a few minutes before the build is completed.

- Clicking on the project **Build** link you will see the build job queued and then completed.
