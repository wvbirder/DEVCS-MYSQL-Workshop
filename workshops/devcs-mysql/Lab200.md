# MYSQL Deployment using Infrastructure as Code

![](images/200/Title200.png) 

## Introduction
In this lab we introductive basic concepts of container deployed Microservices.  We will do this using Developer Cloud Service builds and deployments to the Application Container Cloud Service located in your Trial Account. Two microservices will be deployed. They are both Node.js applications. The REST client application communicates to a backend datasource, which in our case is the MYSQL database running as a Compute instance created in Lab 100. The second deployment is the AlphaOffice UI Node.js application which takes data from the `REST Client` application and displays the results to an end user in a browser.

### **STEP 2**: Verify that Docker is running

**NOTE: For the duration of the Labs it's OK that the login user (holuser vs. opc) and the Docker version may vary from the screenshots**

- **Type** the following:

```
 cd
 docker version
